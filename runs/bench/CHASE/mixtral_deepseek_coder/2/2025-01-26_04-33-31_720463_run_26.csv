Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.\n2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.\n3. Open the card table: Open the card table so we can read from it.\n\n**Finding Cards Without Multiple Faces:**\n1. Start reading the card table: Move to the first row in the card table.\n2. Check if the card doesn't have multiple faces: Look at the side column of the current row in card. If it's not NULL, skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this card entry.\n\n**Finding the Illustrator and Converted Mana Cost:**\n1. Find the corresponding row in card: Use the row ID from the previous step to directly find the matching row in card.\n2. Get the illustrator and converted mana cost: Look at the artist and cmc (converted mana cost) columns in the current row.\n3. Store the illustrator and converted mana cost: Save these two values in registers for later processing.\n\n**Preparing for Final Counting:**\n1. Prepare to compare converted mana costs: Assume the current illustrator has the highest converted mana cost so far.\n\n**Comparing Converted Mana Costs:**\n1. Start reading the card table again: Move to the first row in the card table, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n2. Check if the card doesn't have multiple faces and the illustrator is the same: If the current card has the same illustrator and doesn't have multiple faces, proceed.\n3. Compare the converted mana costs: If the current card's converted mana cost is higher than the previously assumed highest converted mana cost, store the new value as the highest converted mana cost.\n4. Move to the next row in card: Go back to the card table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Prepare the result: Copy the final illustrator and highest converted mana cost to prepare it for output.\n2.

If you want to return only the illustrator and highest converted mana cost for the single illustrator with the overall highest converted mana cost, not per illustrator, use the following SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT artist, MAX(cmc) as highest_cmc FROM card WHERE side IS NULL GROUP BY artist ORDER BY highest_cmc DESC LIMIT 1;\n```"", ""**Preparation Steps:**\n1.

Initialize the highest cost: Set the highest cost to the initial cost found.\n2. Compare the current cost with the highest cost: If the current cost is higher than the highest cost found, update the highest cost with the current cost.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1.

If it's not null, store this value as the champion's time.\n3. Check if the finished time for the rest of the drivers is available: Look at the finished time column for the remaining rows.

Prepare to calculate the percentage difference: If both the champion's time and the last driver's finished time are available, prepare to calculate the percentage difference.\n2.

We need to find the highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level, which is stored in the `RNP` column of the `Laboratory` table.\n2. The question mentions that the patient should have a normal creatinine level. In the database schema, the normal creatinine level is represented as `CRE < 1.5` in the `CRP` column of the `Laboratory` table.\n3. The patient should also have a positive ANA test, which is represented as `Diagnosis = 'ANA(+)'` in the `Patient` table.\n4. Therefore, we join the `Laboratory`, `Patient`, and `Examination` tables to get the required information.\n5. Finally, we use the `MAX` function to find the highest anti-nucleus antibody concentration level for the patient with a normal creatinine level and a positive ANA test.""]",[],{},,,,159.50206542015076

Prepare the result: Copy the final average value to prepare it for output.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Output the result: Output the final average total price of transactions for customers who paid in euros.\n2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n```sql\nSELECT AVG(T2.total_price) FROM customer_payment AS T1 INNER JOIN transaction_info AS T2\nON T1.transaction_id = T2.transaction_id WHERE T1.currency = 'EUR'\n```"", ""**Question**: For the customers who paid in the euro, what is their average total price of the transactions?\n\n**Evidence**: \n- Customers who paid in euro refer to `currency = 'EUR'`\n- The total price of the transactions is stored in the `total_price` column\n\n**Query Plan**:\n\n**Preparation Steps:**\n1. Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.\n2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.\n3. Open the transactions table: Open the transactions table so we can read from it.\n\n**Filtering Customers who Paid in Euro:**\n1. Start reading the transactions table: Move to the first row in the transactions table.\n2. Check if the currency matches: Look at the `currency` column of the current row in transactions. If it's not 'EUR', skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this transaction entry.\n\n**Calculating the Average Total Price:**\n1. Prepare to calculate the average: Initialize a variable to hold the sum of total prices and another variable to hold the count of transactions.\n2. Add the total price to the sum: If the current row passes the currency check, add the `total_price` to the sum.\n3. Increment the count: For each row that passes the currency check, increment the count by 1.\n4. Move to the next row in transactions: Go back to the transactions table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n5. Calculate the average: Divide the sum of total prices by the count of transactions.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Output the result: Output the calculated average total price for the transactions of customers who paid in euro.\n2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n```\nSELECT AVG(total_price) FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'EUR'\n```"", ""**Question**: For the customers who paid in the euro, what is their average total price of the transactions?\n\n**Evidence**: The customer payment currency is represented by the `currency` column in the `customers` table, and the total price of the transactions is stored in the `total_price` column of the `transactions` table.\n\n**Query Plan**:\n\n**Preparation Steps:**\n1. Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.\n2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.\n3.

Start reading the customers table: Move to the first row in the customers table.\n2. Check if the currency matches: Look at the `currency` column of the current row in customers. If it's not 'EUR', skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this customer entry.\n4. Find the corresponding rows in transactions: Use the row ID from customers to directly find the matching rows in transactions.\n\n**Calculating the Average Transaction Price:**\n1. Prepare to calculate the average: Initialize a sum variable and a counter variable for the transactions.\n2. Sum the total prices: For each row identified in the previous step, add the `total_price` value to the sum variable.\n3. Increment the counter: For each row identified in the previous step, increment the counter variable.\n4. Move to the next row in transactions: Go back to the transactions table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n5. Calculate the average: Divide the sum variable by the counter variable to get the average total price.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Output the result: Output the calculated average total price.\n2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.\n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n```\nSELECT AVG(T2.total_price)\nFROM customers AS T1\nJOIN transactions AS T2 ON T1.id_customer = T2.id_customer\nWHERE T1.currency = 'EUR'\n```""]","[""**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\nSELECT AVG(total\\_price)\nFROM transactions\nWHERE currency = 'Euro';"", ""**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n```\nSELECT AVG(total_price) \nFROM transactions \nWHERE currency = 'Euro';\n```"", ""**Final Optimized SQL Query**\n```\nSELECT AVG(total_price)\nFROM transactions\nWHERE currency = 'Euro';\n```""]",[],{},,,,143.65051102638245
