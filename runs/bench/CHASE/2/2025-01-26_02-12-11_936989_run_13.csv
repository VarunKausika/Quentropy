Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.\n2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.\n3. Open the card table: Open the card table so we can read from it.\n\n**Finding Cards Without Multiple Faces:**\n1. Start reading the card table: Move to the first row in the card table.\n2. Check if the card doesn't have multiple faces: Look at the side column of the current row in card. If it's not NULL, skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this card entry.\n\n**Finding the Illustrator and Converted Mana Cost:**\n1. Find the corresponding row in card: Use the row ID from the previous step to directly find the matching row in card.\n2. Get the illustrator and converted mana cost: Look at the artist and cmc (converted mana cost) columns in the current row.\n3. Store the illustrator and converted mana cost: Save these two values in registers for later processing.\n\n**Preparing for Final Counting:**\n1. Prepare to compare converted mana costs: Assume the current illustrator has the highest converted mana cost so far.\n\n**Comparing Converted Mana Costs:**\n1. Start reading the card table again: Move to the first row in the card table, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n2. Check if the card doesn't have multiple faces and the illustrator is the same: If the current card has the same illustrator and doesn't have multiple faces, proceed.\n3. Compare the converted mana costs: If the current card's converted mana cost is higher than the previously assumed highest converted mana cost, store the new value as the highest converted mana cost.\n4. Move to the next row in card: Go back to the card table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Prepare the result: Copy the final illustrator and highest converted mana cost to prepare it for output.\n2.

If you want to return only the illustrator and highest converted mana cost for the single illustrator with the overall highest converted mana cost, not per illustrator, use the following SQL query:\n```sql\nSELECT artist, MAX(cmc) as highest_cmc FROM card WHERE side IS NULL GROUP BY artist ORDER BY highest_cmc DESC LIMIT 1;\n```"", ""**Preparation Steps:**\n1.

Initialize the highest cost: Set the highest cost to the initial cost found.\n2. Compare the current cost with the highest cost: If the current cost is higher than the highest cost found, update the highest cost with the current cost.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1.

We also need to count the total number of races where Hamilton's surname appears and the year is greater than or equal to 2010.
