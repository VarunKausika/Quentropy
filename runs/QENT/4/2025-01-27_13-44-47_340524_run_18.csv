Initialize the process: Start preparing to execute the query.\n2. Prepare storage: Set up storage space (registers) to hold temporary results, initializing them to NULL.\n3. Open the card table: Open the card table so we can read from it.\n\n**Finding Italian Translations:**\n1. Start reading the card table: Move to the first row in the card table.\n2. Check if the language matches: Look at the language column of the current row in card. If it's not 'Italian,' skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this card entry.\n4. Move to the next row in card: Go back to the card table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n\n**Counting Cards per Set:**\n1. Prepare to count cards per set: For each row that matches the language criteria, prepare to include the set size in the final count.\n2. Count cards per set: Increment the count for each unique set ID that meets the language criteria.\n3. Store the set ID and count: Save the set ID and its corresponding count to a temporary storage.\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n1. Output the result: Output the set ID and its corresponding count from the temporary storage.\n2.

Check if the language matches: Look at the language column of the current row in cards. If it's not 'Italian,' skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this cards entry.\n\n**Counting Cards per Set:**\n1. Prepare to count this match: If the current row is an Italian translation, prepare to include this row in the count.\n2. Count this match: Increment the count for each row that meets the criteria of being an Italian translation.\n3. Get the set name: Store the set name (set_name) of the current row.\n4. Get the total set size: Store the total set size (totalSetSize) of the current row.\n5.

Prepare to group sets: Initialize a loop to iterate through the temporary storage.\n2. Group sets and summarize counts: For each set id (setId) in temporary storage, increment a counter for that set id and store the final count (groupCount) in temporary storage.\n3.

Start from the beginning of the cards table: Reset the position to the first row in the cards table.\n2. Check if the card has a text box: Look at the isTextless column of the current row in the cards table. If it's 0, it means that the card has a text box.\n3. Count this match: Increment the count for each row that meets the text box criteria.\n4. Move to the next row in cards: Go back to the cards table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n5. Finalize the count: Once all rows have been checked, finalize the count of matching rows for cards with a text box.\n\n**Calculating the Percentage:**\n\n1. Calculate the Story Spotlight cards percentage: Perform the following calculation - `DIVIDE(SUM(StorySpotlightCount), SUM(TextBoxCount)) * 100`\n\n**Delivering the Result:**\n\n1. Output the result: Output the percentage and list the cards that match all the specified criteria by their ID in the cards table.\n2. End the process: Stop the query execution process.\n\n**Setup phase:** Before starting the actual query execution, the system prepares the specific values, such as `isStorylight = 1` and `isTextless = 0`. \n\n**Final Optimized SQL Query:**\n\n```sql\nWITH StorySpotlightCount AS (\n    SELECT COUNT(id) AS StorySpotlightCount\n    FROM cards\n    WHERE isStorylight = 1\n), TextBoxCount AS (\n
