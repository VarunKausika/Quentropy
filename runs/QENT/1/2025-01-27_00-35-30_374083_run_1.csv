Alternative method solely focusing on available info: Calculating each school name's administrators count in order to mark a few as minimum.\n* **Initial unnecessary SQL combining the previous steps:** \n\n```sql\nSELECT `Admin_Email`\nFROM (\n    SELECT CONCAT(`T1`.`AdmFName1`, '.', `T1`.`AdmLName1`) AS `Admin_Email`, `frpm`.`School Name` AS `School`\n    FROM `california_schools`.`schools` AS `T1`\n    INNER JOIN `california_schools`.`frpm` ON `frpm`.`School Name` = `T1`.`School`\n    WHERE `Charter School` = 1\n) AS `T2`\nWHERE `${T2}`.`School` = (\n    SELECT `frpm`.`School Name`\n    FROM `california_schools`.`frpm`\n    WHERE `Charter School` = 1\n    GROUP BY `frpm`.`School Name`\n    ORDER BY COUNT(`frpm`.`School Name`) ASC\n    LIMIT 1\n)\n```\n\n```diff\n- Due to missing information and inconsistency in enrollment data, this final SQL query\ncould not be determined using the exact cues written.\n\nApologies for the inconvenience, accurate schema information can significantly alter the decomposition process, assist relevant personnel in entering accurate chema info for efficient query generation.\n```""]","[""**Question**: What is the administrator's email address of the chartered school with the fewest students enrolled in grades 1 through 12?\n\n**Evidence**: Chartered school refers to `Charter School (Y/N)` = 1 in the table frpm; Students enrolled in grades 1 through 12 refers to `Enrollment (K-1"", ""**Preparation Steps:**\n1.
