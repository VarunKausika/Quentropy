Check if the card doesn't have multiple faces: Look at the side column of the current row in card. If it's not NULL, skip this row.\n3. Identify the matching row: Store the identifier (row ID) of this card entry.\n4. Find the corresponding row in card: Use the row ID from card to directly find the matching row in card.\n5. Check if the illustrator is not NULL: Look at the artist column in card. If it's NULL, skip this row.\n6. Move to the next row in card: Go back to the card table and move to the next row, repeating the process until all rows are checked.\n\n**Finding the Highest Cost:**\n1. Prepare to find the highest cost: Initialize a variable to store the highest cost found, setting it to a very low value.\n2. Check the converted mana cost: Look at the converted_mana_cost column of the current row in card.\n3. Compare the cost: If the current row's converted mana cost is higher than the stored highest cost, update the highest cost variable with this value.\n4.

Initialize the max cost and corresponding illustrator: Set the initial max cost to the first cost identified in the previous step and the corresponding illustrator to the first illustrator identified.\n2. For each subsequent card row, if the cost is higher than the current max cost, update the max cost and the corresponding illustrator.\n3.

Start with the first card ID from the previous step: Retrieve the card details (ID, cost, and illustrator) by using the stored card IDs.\n2. Check if the cost is higher than the current maximum cost: Compare the cost of the current card with the highest cost found so far. If it's higher, store the artist and cost, replacing the previous ones.\n3. Move to the next card ID from the previous step: Go through each ID to find the card with the highest cost and its illustrator.\n4.

This is done by checking if the `frameEffects` column is `NULL`.\n3. We order the results by the converted mana cost, which is the first number in the `keywords` column. We use `SUBSTRING_INDEX` to extract the first number and `CAST` to convert it to an integer.\n4.
